                                Fire extinguishers require stringent maintenance
                                to ensure they will work when needed, and are
                                more importantly, safe. Fire extinguishers are
                                pressurised vessels that can explode when
                                corroded or damaged, and have been know to cause
                                serious injury and even fatal. â€‹
