                                The main purpose of an Argon fire suppression
                                system is to prevent fires from spreading too
                                far and causing damage to property or buildings.
                                By controlling the amount of air that passes
                                through the system over time, you can keep fires
                                under control without having to constantly move
                                air tanks around.Its most common use is for
                                homes located in remote areas where there are no
                                nearby residents or buildings that may pose a
