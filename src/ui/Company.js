                        values through commitment to grow in a socially and

                        We intend to provide resources in terms of money,
                        medicines, time and equipment to nonprofit organisations
                        to focus on programs that are 'innovative, sustainable
                        and bring real benefits to those most in need'. Our
                        philosophy is to target support to selected programs
                        that are innovative, sustainable and which produce
                        tangible results.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We intend to lend a helping hand to the underprivileged
                        in our society through the support of women, children
                        and the aged in the areas of Health, Education, Public
                        Sanitation etc. Implementing this philosophy in spirit,
                        we shall make a positive contribution to the communities
                        in which we operate, and invest in health and education
                        programs and partnerships that aim to bring sustainable
                        improvements to these people.
